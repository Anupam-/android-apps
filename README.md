##Android apps by Leathrum

This one repository will include several projects.

###Current list of projects with descriptions:

* `MathJaxApp`:  
Displays TeX/MathJax math expressions.
Directory contains source and installation APK files. Originally written as demonstration of using MathJax inside an Android `WebView` object,
but handy for checking TeX math syntax then cutting and pasting into documents.  
Two versions included in the directory:
    * `full`:  self-contained with scaled-down MathJax implementation included as app asset
    * `online`:  uses MathJax loaded from CDN or other location, with configurable URL
