#MathJaxApp

Android app for displaying math expressions entered in TeX/MathJax format.

Originally written as demonstration of using MathJax inside an Android `WebView` object,
but handy for checking TeX math syntax then cutting and pasting into documents.

##Two versions

* "Full" -- standalone version with small MathJax installation included as an application asset  
(source directory: `full`)
* "Online" -- loads MathJax from an online source, default being the MathJax CDN, but the URL is configurable  
(source directory: `online`)

##Files

* Installation packages (APK):
    * `MathJaxAppFull.apk`
    * `MathJaxAppOnline.apk`
* `LICENSE` -- Apache version 2.0 license statement, for both versions of the app (each app source directory also includes a `NOTICE` file)
